Code formatting

	ctrl + shift + f
	
	to auto format code

For each java class

/**
  *@author "author name"
  *@date "date created"
  */

For each class constructor

/**
  *"Description of what the constructor will do"
  *@param "name of argument" : "concise description of argument" - for each argument passed through the constructor
  */
Paramaters for each constructor should be the same as the field names within the class. The constructor method should then copy these parameters as, for example:
	this.supplierID = supplierID;

For each method

/**
  *"short description of what the method will do"
  *@param "name of argument" : "concise description of argument" -  for each argument passed through the method

	or

  *@return "concise description of the type of data that is being returned"
  */

When updating another authors work

	add below existing java doc on the work modified

/**
  *"Last modified"
  *@author "author who modified"
  *@date "date modified"
  */
